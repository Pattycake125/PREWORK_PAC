12 Keys to success 

I am pne of the older students in this call to be sure. 
I have done the self trained method and for many years I have successfully "cowboyed" my way thru code.

It is not enough. I have worked in the real world and taught myself solutions. But any coder looking at my code 
would be ashamed. It is time, I learn to tune up the car with real life goals in mind. 

Below are my thoughts on these twelve keys. Some will need constant addressing.

1. A Little Humility Never Hurt Nobody.. I KNOW I don't know.

2. There is No Coding Pill... I have always wanted thie, but we would be unhireable if we had it.

3. Put in the Hard Hours (At Least 20 Hours!)...I have quit my Job to focus solely on learning to code better.

4. Patience Makes Perfect... Patience with knowledge is far better than trying my way to learn, earn and produce.

5. Not a Spectator Sport... I have NEVER been just a spectator.

6. Crumple the Paper Tiger... There was Never anyone for me to ask, results are the only teacher.

7. Find a Squad...  I would desparately LOVE to work with some hot shots who can offer as much hints as I can.

8. Master the Art of Google Fu... This is another area I NEED help.

9. Plan Often... I like starting with overview... " Make toast"  then break down to steps, then branches.

10. Fixing Things Takes Time...I have dedicated the time.

12. You Can Do This! YES because the money is where the learning is
